# On A Boat

This is project is supposed to be a kind of dashboard for naval transportation. 
The main function is to measure the speed of the vessel in knots but you can also see your speed in m/s and in km/h. 
The dashboard also contains the bearing and coordinates of the device and can be used for navigation. 

Future implementations will hopefully contain charts to show the avg. speed over a period of time.
